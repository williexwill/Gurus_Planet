# Project Proposal:

## Guru’s Planet:



On March 8, 1994, Brooklyn-based hip hop duo Gang Starr released their fourth studio album, *Hard to Earn*. Track 6, [“The Planet"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atdvWo4yzRI), is an autobiographical account of the emcee Guru’s move from his native Boston to  Brooklyn, and it name checks a number of locations where he spent his time as he was introduced to the borough. My goal with this project is to chart those locations on an interactive map along with corresponding [lyrics](https://genius.com/Gang-starr-the-planet-lyrics), and if scope allows, accompanying historical points of interest and [historically appropriate images](https://www.oldnyc.org/) (Guru seems to have moved to Brooklyn in [1983](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-METROB-438#:~:text=After%20graduating%20from%20Morehouse%20College,a%20New%20York%20Times%20obituary.)).

To complete this project, I’ll create my own data set, compiling appropriate coordinates for the geographic landmarks (be they specific locations, neighborhoods, or streets) cited in the song’s lyrics. I’m imagining a single map displayed alongside the lyrics for the song. Both the lyrics and the map will be interactive. The lyrics will have clickable elements that pan the map. And the geographic highlights will have popup tool tips that will include the additional information I mentioned above.
